	Responsibilities/Accomplishments:
	
•	Reviewed the future requirements for business improvement and ICT service delivery at Council and proposed options, recommendations and high level transition arrangements in relation to an ICT service delivery model, potential organisation structure and a resourcing strategy for the structure. This work included organisational change management activities to assist Council’s executive team, information services personnel and other stakeholders in understanding and agreeing the proposed changes and benefits.
•	Established, coordinated and controlled the transitioning of information services personnel (two branches) to the new structure (one branch) and the new business engagement model. I concurrently recast the information services budget resulting in savings of over $1 million in salaries alone and established the enterprise architecture function and team within Council. There were no Industrial Relations incidents generated from this activity and over ninety five percent of the personnel were retained.

o	Supporting the transition of information and support services to a revised and entirely commercial business model for the delivery of all Council customer facing services through a separate entity similar in concept to outsourcing. This support included restructuring and transitioning components of the information service function into the new customer service entity.
o	“Localising”, scaling and implementing the agreed whole-of-Council (including business change and heavy engineering) portfolio, program and project management methodologies. An associated initiative was establishment of a Portfolio, Program and Project Management office to oversee the utilisation of the agreed methodologies, assist the stakeholders with usage, quality assurance and reporting and ensure appropriate governance, structure and resource assignment/utilisation are in place.
o	Establishment of a new (backup) load-sharing data centre to house in excess of 200 servers and associated communications equipment then transitioning the existing backup data centre to the new centre.
o	Supporting the SEQ water reform imperatives including preparation for divestment of the water business from Council and transition of ICT service to the new entities.
o	Re-planning and re-implementing three modules of the ERP (Asset management, purchase to pay and projects and programs).
o	Ongoing BAU requirements for change across the application portfolio of ERP, planning and development and approximately 400 other local government applications.
o	Working with the businesses to understand, measure and report on benefits realisation from all ERP related activity including adjustment of business processes and other remedial activities so that the planned benefits could be harvested.
o	Development of a five-year technology roadmap for Council.
o	Renegotiation of Council’s communication services and their service provider including transition of mobile services to a new provider.
o	Establishment of integrated initiatives to implement and/or improve service delivery processes across information services functions including transitioning some processes to ITIL compliancy.
•	Assisted in development of the initial project plans, schedules and registers that will be utilised to establish the water retailing entity to the requirements of the contributing Councils who will own the business. This work was performed in an environment of legislative uncertainty and with ultimate full retail contestability in mind.
	
	Another outcome of my work at Ipswich City Council is the completion of the initial tasks I assigned to the enterprise architecture team, which was to produce a fully articulated and agile five year technology roadmap that was aligned to corporate strategy and integrated to all business priorities and processes. That roadmap is now considered by the technology vendors (such as Oracle) as one of the most advanced business-aligned information services environments within a local government in Queensland and may be considered as demonstrating capability maturity model level 5 (Optimizing).

He is highly intelligent, has good analytical and communication skills, is extremely organized, and is able to follow through to ensure that the job gets done.

I was fortunate to work with Ken during his time at Ipswich City Council. He had a particular strengths in synergizing complex problems into creative solutions that drive business improvement and success. I first met Ken during the work he was doing in bringing together Council's ICT and Business Improvement functions. He was able to quickly identify pertinent issues and build structural and performance scenarios which led the organisation to a new Enterprise Solutions model. Rather than leaving the organisation after the completion of the strategy work, as many consultants choice to do, he agreed to lead the implementation of the change process for the new branch, establishing new operating processes and systems, and driving cultural change. Ken has provided an effective business platform that ensures the Enterprise Business Solutions Branch can deliver on long overdue business improvements, can define a new ICT strategic direction for the organisation and can meet the challenges for the organisation of managing one of the fastest growing regions in Australia.

I would work with Ken again without hesitation and find his clear and direct style both refreshing and effective.

Executive Sponsor on behalf of the Director General
mr.ed.co@mainroads.qld.gov.au
I have worked with Ken in the past and have maintained contact with him since he left our organisation and pursued other career interests. I first came across Ken when I was the customer for a significant IT project which was extremely high on the CEO’s agenda. I was immediately impressed with the discipline Ken brought to the process, the understanding of the wider application of the initiative and benefits to be realised in the longer term. Many associated with the project had not previously been exposed to a business solutions approach. Up until that time, rigour and discipline associated with the project had been thought to be on track. In a short space, Ken was able to demonstrate to me the short comings to date and the full application of a benefits realisation approach. Ken’s approach crystallised our thinking and moved us from considering the project to being another tool to one of being the key approach to electronic business. Ken and I have from time to time spoken about cultural dynamics. In particular, we have zeroed in on: • Cost effectiveness • Customer service delivery focus • Forward Thinking From these discussions I have formed the opinion that Ken is pretty business savvy. He has an in-depth knowledge of the industry served and could easily pick up a company’s business strategy, operating model, value proposition, market position and competition. He has had a fairly broad career and has an sound appreciation of the principles of accounting, finance, supply chain management, marketing, sales and distribution channels, both traditional and online. Ken has a fair deal of expertise in aligning and leveraging technology for the advantage of the enterprise. He has told me the range of projects he has been involved with and the specific facets of technology such as ERP, Web infrastructure, e-commerce, CRM, sales force automation, data warehousing. Also (but to a lesser extent) his experience with specific application software packages such as Oracle e-Business

Ken successfully initiated a new program to perform tactical improvements to the department’s internet and intranet whilst also strategically enabling a new web service capability for Main Roads. Ken built up a team to manage strategic and tactical work and was fundamental in ensuring that 2 tactical releases of the internet were implemented successfully. Ken is delivery focused and provides clear direction based on a wealth of commercial experience in ICT program management. I enjoyed working with Ken, he is an expert program manager that can provide a clear vision to meeting strategic requirements, build the team and make it happen.

Ken is an outstanding professional consultant who sets and achieves the highest standards in each of his areas of work. He sets a very high bar in the area of program management, in which role I had the privilege to judge Ken's professional certification as a Master Project Director. Ken's attention to detail, and his reflection of best practice in the strategic governance of the program and in his direction of the project delivery level was genuinely impressive. I would count Ken as one of the most professional and informed program managers I have encountered. He has a great style with his team, and a good manner of managing upwards as well, combined with a great sense of humour that adds to his collegiate value.

Ken is one of the sharpest IT Managers that I've met and has a rare capacity to make an accurate and intelligent assessment of a problem situation and then create a practical fix to address an often complex set of issues. Seeing him perform this role in companies over a 10 year period, he also has the ability to bridge the gap between technology performance and business need while being tuned in to the politics of an organisation. Being able to address the executive agenda while motivating the troops is a demanding balancing act which Ken seems to pull off time and again. What the top team also like is to have his clear picture of the financials and the R.O.I. and not be confused by the jargon. An admirable set of personal values complete the mix, Ken's integrity sometimes leads to comments which others might find uncomfortable but I find simply honest.

Although it happens rarely, it is always a pleasure to work with someone who not only understands and can execute the formalities of IT delivery but can also achieve results through strategic and creative thinking. Ken Garrard is one such person. At MIM Ken was catapulted into a project to deliver a new intranet. Before it began, it was clear that the project had most of the high risk factors that go hand in hand with IT projects. At the top of that list was the diversity of the user base across multiple remote sites. Everyone in the organisation was to be impacted by the project and this meant significant political and cultural challenges. Ken took up the challenge and showed considerable insight and skill in his communications with, and building of, working relationships with key stakeholders at each site. The project technology was a hybrid of software modules and bespoke development. Ken was tasked to select and manage a vendor for the solution delivery. His skills were quickly apparent as the team struggled with leading edge Oracle technologies. Innovative solutions were required and Ken’s ability to lead and motivate the team through these periods was a key factor to the project being on time and under budget. Ken’s capacity to listen and understand was instrumental in this projects success. To respect other’s views and drive to mutually beneficial outcomes is clearly demonstrated in the enduring relationships he still has with the customer, the vendor, and the IT team to this day.

“I am writing to thank you on behalf of MIM and its staff for the outstanding work of your team in delivering MIM's Intranet project so successfully.
MIM Senior Management as well as the people on the ground are well aware of the enormous effort, long hours and dedication required to meet a challenging timetable, frantic environment and dealing with the scope change along the way.
You and your team are truly excellent professionals and we will be very pleased if not anxious to work with you again.”
